# dsh-context-rollover

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) bundle for
**model-driven context self-management**: the model can deliberately end one
working context window and continue in a fresh one while preserving durable
state — with **no summarization**.

```text
fresh working context + durable model-managed notes + small recent raw tail + recoverable full history
```

Inspired by the context-management architecture in `openai/codex` (the
`new_context` tool, token-budget compaction without a summarizer, history/notes
separation) and `pi-posthorse`. Codex is the architectural reference; DSH is the
implementation authority — everything runs through DSH's own surface-replace
protocol and compaction transaction.

## How it works

The plugin provides the active `ctx.compaction` engine (it disables
`dsh-compaction-basic` in its bundle patch). On the Web profile the engine
must additionally live in the session's agent preset — see
[Web profiles](#web-profiles-preset-sessions) below. A rollover is a real DSH
compaction: `compaction/start` → `compaction/summary` → one replacement
`user/message` with full source provenance → `compaction/end` — but the
"summary" is a **deterministic checkpoint** (durable notes plus an optional
handoff), never an LLM call. Raw session events stay persisted; a
token-budgeted recent tail stays verbatim on the surface; `deriveMessages()`
rebuilds automatically.

Responsibilities stay split (the Codex lesson):

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Request a boundary | `new_context` tool (records a pending request only) |
| Cross the boundary | `agent/pre-step` (before the next model request) and `agent/turn-stopping` |
| Track windows | rollover count + summary seqs read from the durable log |
| Measure pressure | `ctx.tokenMeter` + the routed model's context window |
| Replace the surface | `commitRollover` inside DSH's compaction transaction |
| Preserve selected state | `notes` tool (markdown files per session) |
| Recover old details | `history` tool (search/read over shadowed surface events) |

### Model-facing tools

- **`new_context({ handoff? })`** — request a context boundary at the next safe
  point. The handoff (bounded) becomes part of the new window's checkpoint. The
  boundary is crossed at a safe lifecycle point, never mid-tool-batch.
- **`get_context_remaining()`** — honest headroom, in the window's own terms:
  the prompt tokens the next request would submit, the room left in the hard
  window, and the growth left before the automatic rollover — or "not measured
  yet". It is a projection that moves with every turn (a rollover lowers it),
  never a tally of what has been spent. The same quantity drives the pressure
  reminder and the rollover threshold, measured as the prompt a request would
  carry and not as the previous call's prompt plus its output.
- **`notes`** — `list | read | write | append | search` over per-session
  markdown files under `<dsh home>/notes/<session id>/`. Nothing is written
  automatically; the model decides what survives.
- **`history`** — `search | read` over conversation that left the active
  surface. Targeted recovery, not wholesale reconstruction.

### Rollover paths

1. **Model-driven** (preferred): the model saves notes, calls `new_context`
   with a short handoff at a phase boundary (research → implementation, etc.).
2. **Pressure** (safety net): above `thresholdRatio` of the window the engine
   rolls over automatically with durable notes and the recent verbatim tail.
   Below that, a **one-per-window** checkpoint reminder suggests saving notes
   and rolling over.
3. **Overflow**: a provider-confirmed `CONTEXT_WINDOW_EXCEEDED` forces a
   rollover with the same notes + tail checkpoint and retries the request.
4. **Manual**: `/compact` keeps working — it performs the same standalone
   notes + tail rollover on an idle agent.

Only the model-driven path carries a **handoff**. The engine never writes one
for pressure, overflow, or manual rollovers: producing a handoff itself would
mean either an LLM summarization call or copying older user messages into the
fresh window, and the second option revives stale requests. Those paths
preserve intent through notes and the recent verbatim tail instead.

## What this plugin touches

- **Registers four model-facing tools** (`new_context`, `get_context_remaining`, `notes`, `history`)
  and one system-prompt section — on headless profiles in every session; on
  the Web profile only inside `standard-rollover` sessions (other presets stay
  exactly as shipped).
- **Writes files** in exactly one place: markdown notes under `<dsh home>/notes/<sessionId>/`.
  Nothing else on disk is written; no network calls, no telemetry.
- **Replaces the active compaction backend** (`compaction-basic` is disabled by the bundle patch).
  Session logs stay fully compatible in both directions.
- **No credentials, no cloud services, no data leaves the machine.**

## Host version compatibility

The plugin typechecks against **both** host lines: the development checkout and
its installed profiles (`0.1.5-rc.1`, via generated tsconfig paths) and the
newest packages published to public npm (`0.0.1-rc.1`, the
`pnpm typecheck:compat` probe against `compat/node_modules`). Runtime
differences are bridged in `src/compat.ts`:

- the session log as `snapshotEvents()` (newer line) or `events` (published);
- `eventAt(seq)` versus indexing that array;
- per-node pricing as `heuristicTokens` (newer line) or `tokens`;
- the replacement operation as `{ startSeq, endSeq }` (newer line) or
  `{ start, end }`, probed once per process because each line rejects the
  other's field names.

Note the published `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages are a *partial* mirror: some
of their peers reference packages that were never published publicly, so a
standalone npm-only host graph cannot be assembled. That is expected — the
plugin's peers resolve from the running dsh host's installation closure, and
installing the plugin itself into a profile fetches only this package.

## Install

From npm (recommended):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add dsh-context-rollover
# or, without the dsh CLI:
pnpm --dir "$DSH_HOME/profiles/<profile>" add dsh-context-rollover
```

A custom profile initializes with just `dsh-base`; the bundle's patch applies
automatically because the package declares `dsh.bundle.patch`. After the first
install (a bundle-membership change is a boot-time composition), start the
profile once — the plugin's peer packages resolve from the running host's
installation closure, never from npm.

From GitHub instead of npm:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add github:athif23/dsh-context-rollover
```

From a local checkout (development, see the HMR section below):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add D:/path/to/dsh-context-rollover
```

**Windows note**: if the plugin loads but its `@deepseek-ai/*` imports fail at
runtime after an install from Git Bash, pnpm may have materialized broken
`link:` junctions (a Git Bash/Windows path-mangling bug). Recreate them with
`cmd /c mklink /J` as described in the HMR section below — the same fix
applies to any linked sibling package in the profile.

The bundle's `cordis.patch.yml` disables `dsh-compaction-basic` and mounts the
`context-rollover` engine itself. `command-compact`, the token meter, and the
compaction invariant companions need no changes — they depend only on
`ctx.compaction`.

### Web profiles (preset sessions)

Headless and other base-only profiles are done after the install above: the
host engine *is* the session's engine, no roster exists, and nothing stands
down. The Web profile is different — its sessions compose compaction from
their **agent preset**, not from the host — so the bundle additionally
registers a shipped `standard-rollover` preset ("Standard + rollover
(experimental)" in the picker) beside the deployment's own set. Restart the
host once after install, then open **new** sessions on it to try the
experiment; `standard` stays the default. Existing sessions stay on whatever
they started with.

No commands, no profile edits. Two behaviors make that hold:

- The host engine **defers to any preset-owned backend**: on a `standard`
  session the shipped summarizer runs alone (previously the two backends
  raced each pressure signal); on `standard-rollover` the preset's rollover
  engine runs alone; headless sessions keep the host engine.
- The preset's engine row sets `modelSurface: 'always'`, so it is the only
  source of rollover tools and guidance in its sessions. On preset
  deployments the host row (`modelSurface: 'auto'`) registers neither, so
  `standard` and `minimal` sessions never see rollover-framed instructions.

Custom thresholds belong to your own preset copy (the supported customization
flow: copy `standard-rollover` in the picker and edit the `context-rollover`
row) — the shipped preset carries the defaults below. If a deployment
restates the whole `agent-presets` config in a later patch layer, that layer
wins and hides the shipped preset; re-adding the bundle's root there
restores it. Uninstalling the bundle removes the preset: sessions already on
it keep running, new ones must pick another preset.

Maintainers: `presets/standard-rollover/` is generated, not authored —
re-run `pnpm preset:sync` after harness updates and commit the refresh. The
sync keeps everything else byte-identical and fails loud when the shipped
`standard` shape drifts.

Configuration (cordis.yml `config` on the plugin row):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: context-rollover
      name: dsh-context-rollover
      config:
        thresholdRatio: 0.9          # automatic rollover point (fraction of window)
        reminderThresholdRatio: 0.75 # one-time checkpoint reminder point
        retainRatio: 0.1             # recent verbatim tail (fraction of window)
        retainTokens: null           # absolute tail budget; overrides retainRatio
        handoffMaxChars: 20000
        notesEnabled: true
        historyEnabled: true
        notesDir: null               # base dir override; default <dsh home>/notes
        modelSurface: auto           # auto (host rows) | always (preset rows)
```

## Local development with HMR

The fast loop runs DSH from your checkout with the plugin linked from this
directory and Cordis HMR watching the source:

1. **Create a dedicated profile and link this package**

   ```sh
   dsh plugin --profile rollover-dev add D:/path/to/dsh-context-rollover
   ```

   (A custom profile initializes with just `dsh-base`; the bundle's patch
   applies automatically because the package declares `dsh.bundle.patch`.)

2. **Enable the `hmr` row** in `$DSH_HOME/profiles/rollover-dev/cordis.patch.yml`
   (patch rows replace whole configs, so restate `root`):

   ```yaml
   - id: hmr
     config:
       root: ['.', 'D:/path/to/dsh-context-rollover/src']
       debounce: 100
   ```

   The base bundle mounts `hmr` disabled by default; the `timer` row it needs
   is already active.

3. **Run DSH from source**

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/deepseek-harness
   pnpm run build          # once; Typert host artifacts are required
   pnpm dsh --profile rollover-dev
   ```

   Source launch runs through tsx (`node --import tsx/esm`), which is what makes
   hot reload of TypeScript plugin sources work.

4. **Edit `src/*.ts` in this package** — the affected plugin reloads in place;
   registrations (tools, system-prompt sections, event listeners) unwind and
   reapply through Cordis effects. Profile patch edits also recompose live
   (`patchReload: live` is the default for custom profiles).

5. **Restart is still required for**: initial bundle installation, bundle
   membership changes (`dsh.plugin add/remove`), framework-level dependency
   changes (Cordis falls back to `loader.exit()`), and anything HMR cannot
   safely swap.

### Windows: `link:` junctions and Git Bash

`pnpm install` in a profile run from Git Bash mangles `link:D:/...`
specifiers into junctions with invalid targets (the drive colon is treated
as relative). If a profile's linked plugins fail to load after an install,
recreate the junctions with the real targets:

```sh
cmd /c mklink /J "%DSH_HOME%\profiles\web\node_modules\dsh-context-rollover" "D:\path\to\dsh-context-rollover"
```

(or run the install from PowerShell/cmd). This package's own runtime peers
are junctions into the shared installation closure at
`$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/*`. That is what lets the
engine share the host's module instances: a service plugin that extends
`CompactionEngine` must import the exact classes the host loaded, so
resolving its `@deepseek-ai/*` imports through the same closure as the host
is load-bearing, not an optimization.

## Tests and typecheck (no DSH build needed)

The DSH source checkout is the source of truth: `tsconfig.base.json` paths are
generated into `tsconfig.dsh-paths.json` and vitest aliases execute everything
from TypeScript source — the same source plane DSH's own suites use. Vendored
packages typecheck against their built declarations so `skipLibCheck` absorbs
their relaxed strictness.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test        # surface, notes, history, engine integration, tool rendering
pnpm typecheck
```

Tests mount the real session store, token meter, tool runtime, agent loop, and
**the compaction invariant companions**, so every committed rollover is
validated against DSH's own invariants. The integration test proves the
semantic experiment end to end: the model researches, calls `new_context`
mid-turn, and the fresh window carries notes + handoff + recent tail while the
turn continues.

## Working in this checkout

This checkout keeps a deliberately strict **public zone / dev zone** split:
`main` and `feature/*` are publishable and PR-ready, while `dev`, local notes,
the DSH checkout, and machine-specific config live in a private, gitignored dev
zone backed by a local bare remote. A pre-push guard blocks dev-zone material
from reaching GitHub. [`ZONES.md`](ZONES.md) is the reference;
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the workflow.

```sh
pnpm dev:setup    # pinned DSH checkout + deps + private remote + zone guard
pnpm dev:doctor   # is the environment wired correctly?
pnpm dev:verify   # prove the zone split holds (guard matrix + repo state)
```

Two differences from a plain checkout, both local-only:

- the DSH sources are resolved by `scripts/dsh-dir.mjs` — `DSH_CHECKOUT_DIR`
  (environment, then `.env.local`), else `vendor/deepseek-harness`, which
  `pnpm dev:setup` clones at the pinned ref. CI keeps working with
  `DSH_CHECKOUT_DIR=./deepseek-harness`;
- `pnpm build` resolves `@deepseek-ai/*` to built declarations, preferring a
  built checkout and otherwise the host installation closure
  (`$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai`); `DSH_BUILD_TYPES_DIR`
  overrides it. `pnpm dev:doctor` reports which source is in use.

## Scope and limits

- A rollover checkpoint contains durable notes, the model's handoff when it
  supplied one, and the retained verbatim tail that sits outside the
  checkpoint. No older user prompts are copied into it.
- Notes survive context rollovers within a session; no cross-session sync,
  embeddings, or cloud storage.
- Notes are files, not session events: `Session.append` cannot mark a plugin's
  custom event types `ignorable`, so unknown plugin events on a session log
  would make that log unreadable by any DSH build without the plugin. Only
  known event types (`compaction/*`, `user/message`) are written.
- The generic `<compaction>` checkpoint provenance is reused, so transcript UIs
  recognize rollover checkpoints like any compaction.
- No DSH core was forked or patched; the plugin only consumes public seams.
