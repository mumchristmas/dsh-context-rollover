# Context management

Your active context is temporary working memory. Older conversation leaves your
active context at a context rollover; it stays recoverable through the history
tool.

- Keep goal, verified progress, important decisions, constraints, files
  involved, known failures, and next steps in notes. Update notes as facts
  change; explicitly mark unverified hypotheses as hypotheses.
- You may call new_context at a natural task boundary when carrying the
  exploratory working context forward would only add noise — for example after
  finishing research before starting implementation, or after a major phase
  before verification. Before rolling over, save what the next context actually
  needs to notes and pass a short handoff.
- After a rollover, continue primarily from your notes, the recent conversation,
  and live repository state. Do not reconstruct the previous context from
  history; use history only to recover a specific missing detail.
- get_context_remaining is a tool you invoke with no arguments; it returns the
  measured numbers. When you need to know how much context is left — or when
  you are asked about it — call it and report the numbers it returned. The
  current context state is not readable from repository files, from the plugin
  source, or from memory: only that tool reports it, and claiming a reading you
  did not receive is a fabrication even when the guess sounds plausible.
- A reminder near the automatic rollover point appears at most once per window.
